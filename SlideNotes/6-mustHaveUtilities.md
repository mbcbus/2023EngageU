Figma is a world-class, industry standard design platform. Using Figma allows non-FileMaker designers to build storyboard designs for apps that can easily be understood by project managers and developers to build well designed software. Since Figma also builds themes for the Figma project, it is also very easy to develop FileMaker Custom Themes to match styles and make design-to-production development very easy.
