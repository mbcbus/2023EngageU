Demo of a proof of concept file requiring hands free FileMaker usage

## Demo Points
- Activate and Deactivate the microphone
- Voice commands
- Speech-to-text dictation

## Special Considerations
- Mostly everything here revolves around MacOS accessibility features. 
- Dragon Naturally Speaking, a popular dictation program, was discontinued for MacOS.
- The demo file for this will not be attached here.
